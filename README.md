# Keycloak Identity Provider for Steam and Discord

## How to use:

### Discord
Setup new application in https://discord.com/developers with proper redirect URL (quite important to mention that the defined redirect URL defined must match **exactly**. It right redirect URL could be found in the Administration Console above.)

### Steam
Fill Client Id and Client Secret field with any data (it's not in use but still mandatory to fill) grab an API Key in https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey and then it should hopefully work.
